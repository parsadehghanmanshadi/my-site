        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Parsa Dehghan Manshadi, a gray hat hacker and passionate tech enthusiast. Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by the world of hacking and cybersecurity, and Iâ€™m constantly learning and exploring new techniques to better understand the digital landscape. My journey into hacking began with curiosity, and over time, it has evolved into a deep interest in ethical hacking, penetration testing, and securing systems from vulnerabilities.

In addition to my hacking skills, I specialize in Python programming, web development, and artificial intelligence. I have a strong background in Django and love experimenting with new technologies to build cutting-edge applications.

Iâ€™ve been involved in various gray hat hacking activities, focusing on understanding security flaws and finding creative solutions to enhance system protection. My goal is always to learn from the ethical side, ensuring that I contribute positively to the tech community while sharpening my skills.

When Iâ€™m not coding or exploring the digital world, youâ€™ll find me playing volleyball, reading about cybersecurity, or spending time with friends. Iâ€™m always up for new challenges and looking for opportunities to grow both professionally and personally.

If youâ€™re interested in connecting or discussing hacking, programming, or technology in general, feel free to reach out. You can contact me at:
